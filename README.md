# Simple Encrypt
   * Simple Encrypt is as it seems a simple Key Cipher program that was created in python, so that I could learn about the subject. Its a form of a Caesar Cipher, but with a little twist. It comes with a larger base set of encryptable values (Not just letters) and the number of levels of encrpytion are based on the index's that the user provides. For example I could pass an index of [45,23,12,6] and this would act as the index and the number of encryptions that occur during the ecryption process. Please note that while this would be very hard for a human to crack its not that hard to Brute force break this encryption method. 

## Features:
   * Encrypt / Decrypt Stings 
   * Encrypt /Decrypt Text Files

| ------------- |:-------------:|
| --help| Command to list Help for the program. |
| -f | Flag to pass a File path. |
| -s | Flag to pass a String to the script. |

## Updates:
  * Changed the Index to take a list of values, and it acts like a Combo or
    password. Making the level of Encryption that much better.
